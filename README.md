# Senior_Thesis
## this repo has been made to use the MMS Micromouse Maze Simulator by Mackarone to demo the following algorithms in a micromouse Mazde context:
### Left Wall Follower
### Breadth-first Search
### Depth-First Search 
### Floodfill

## in order to run the algorithms, first follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/mackorone/mms?tab=readme-ov-file#download) to download the simulator.

## once the simulator is installed follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/mackorone/mms-python?tab=readme-ov-file#setup) to set up the micromouse to run the algorithms in the simulator. 
### NOTE: instead of "mms-python", the directory will be "Senior_Thesis" 

## each algorithm is ran in its own file:
### Left Wall Follower in Left_Wall_Follower.py
### Breadth-first Search in DFS_Then_BFS.py
### Depth-First Search in DFS_With_DFS_Result.py
### Floodfill in floodfill.py

## Here is a picture of the robot created for this project aswell!
